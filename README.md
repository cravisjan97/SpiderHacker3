This app is similar to task 3.
But here the url from which data is extracted is not http://spider.nitt.edu/~vishnu/time.php
but it is a url generated using my computer as a server.
Wamp is used to host a server on my computer and ngrok is used to portforward the localhost.It 
provides an url which is accessible to all.

The links for the apk files are:
